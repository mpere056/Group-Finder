# Group-Finder

## What is it?
I got the idea to make this while learning about non distinct groups in abstract algebra.
It was originally meant to output non distinct groups of a given size.
I later realized I could also input a sudoku puzzle into this and it will find all the possible solutions for it.

## How to use it?
It currently has a sudoku board entered into line 147.<br/>
Size 9 will need to be used for sudoku.<br/>
The function on line 148 can be used instead of 147 to create non distinct groups of given size.<br/>
The comments on lines 55-93 can be interchanged to optimize for finding non distinct groups.<br/>
